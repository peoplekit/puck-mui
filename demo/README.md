# Demo - Puck-Mui

This is a simple demo built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React. The following instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the app locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), depending on your preference)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peoplekit/puck-mui.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd puck-mui/demo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once inside the demo directory, install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and the app will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use).
